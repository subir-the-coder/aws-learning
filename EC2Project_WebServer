Launched my very own EC2 Web Server in the AWS cloud
✔️ Created and configured the security group
✔️ Wrote a custom bootstrapping script to automate Apache setup
✔️ SSH'd into the instance and edited files manually
✔️ Applied some cool glassmorphism in HTML/CSS
✔️ Displayed live public & private IPs using EC2 metadata

Feels amazing to bring something alive directly from the cloud 🌩️
many more AWS adventures ahead!
